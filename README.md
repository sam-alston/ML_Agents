# ML_Agents
Contains Unity ML Agents projects

These are educational projects created to learn about Machine Learning and the ML-Agents Unity library.

1. HungryBlocks is a completely original project that trains a cube to navigate a room with no obstacles to find a target.

2. Penguins is an update to the code walkthrough in: https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/unity-ml-agents-penguins
Several of the functions used in the immersive limit example have been deprecated for ML-Agents, so this included new and original elements mixed with the tutorial code.
